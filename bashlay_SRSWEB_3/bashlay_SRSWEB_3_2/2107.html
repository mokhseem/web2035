      <p>The superb Riva 1600SLX looks, fells and behaves like a top of the range saloon.</p>
      <p>The thoroughbred 1568cc OHC engine is free revving and provides a gutsy 85 bhp, which is transferred to the road via a smooth 5 speed gearbox.</p>
      <p>Once inside the 1600SLX you know you're in a car with class.</p>
      <p>Slide into the luxuriously padded and fully contoured front seats which give you the right support for all driving conditions.</p>
      <p>Facing the driver is a neatly laid out and comprehensive instrument panel. There's a quality radio cassette with front mounted speakers and clock.</p>
      <p>A powerful heating system with two side window demister vents, keeps the passengers warm and the view ahead clear.</p>
      <p>There's a four spoke steering whell with integral horn, door operated interior light, safety lights in the front door edges, illuminated glove box, specially designed wheel trims, full length side body moulding to prevent paint chipping and much more.</p>
      <p>Of course, along with the bigger engine you get increased towing capacity (27.5 cwt) so you can pull just about anything.</p>
