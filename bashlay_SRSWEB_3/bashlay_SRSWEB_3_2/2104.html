      <p>The new Riva Estates. They're based, like every Lada, on providing not just a big load carrying capacity, but saloon car comfort. In this way we have changed very little. Even the prices come as a nice surprise. What we have added however, are some stylish refinements and some up to the minute features.</p>
      <p>This hungry estate can swallow up to 42 cu. ft. of whatever you care to load them with (when the rear seats are folded) and still ensure a comfortable journey for driver and passengers alike. But just look at these standard features: fully reclining front seats, adjustable head restraints and, on the 1500 model, full cloth upholstery. And there's carpeting in the driver/passenger area.</p>
      <p>The first thing you'll notice is the smart new rear light cluster. It incorporates powerful new reversing lights and high intensity rear fog lights. There's heated rear window too, complete with its own wash/wipe system for improved visibility.</p>
      <p>What we haven't changed is the wide opening tailgate which makes loading so easy thanks to the low rear sill.</p>
      <p>New recessed door handles, the overall smoother lines and, on the 1500, an elegant new coachline, add the final touches to the new Riva Estates. They promise all the versatility and comfort they have to delivered in the past, but they're just that much more refined, stylish and better equipped.</p>
