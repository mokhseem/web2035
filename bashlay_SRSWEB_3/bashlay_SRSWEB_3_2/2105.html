      <p>Thousands of motorists are now enjoying their first taste of new car motoring thanks to the Riva 1200L. For its size and specification there's still nothing to touch it at the price.</p>
      <p>It's true family sized saloon, built around Lada's robust 1198cc OHC engine which gives lively performance and very respectable fuel economy (at a constant 56 MPH it returns over 35 MPG).</p>
      <p>What's more, the Riva 1200L (like all Ladas) can run on healthier, cheaper unleaded petrol without any mechanical adjustment.</p>
      <p>The four doors open wide to make it easy to get in and out of and once inside you'll find there's plenty of room for 5 adults.</p>
      <p>There's no shortage of creature comfort either. Fully reclining front seats with head restraints, moulded armrests and full deep pile carpeting gives you some idea of the standards.</p>
      <p>Then there's the added safety of rear interia reel seatbelts and a centre lap belt, a dim/dip facility on the headlights for safer night driving and the extra protection of the reinforced roof and body.</p>
      <p>Braking is sure and sensitive, the dashboard is modern and comprehensive while overall the ride is smooth and steady thanks to the reinforced suspension.</p>
      <p><em>The Riva 1200L. Economy, space, style. From Lada.</em></p>
