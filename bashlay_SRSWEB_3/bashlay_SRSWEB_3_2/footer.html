        A man buys a Lada but after only one day of ownership returns it to the garage. 'It's no good mate, the car's no good for me,' says the man to the car dealer. 'Why not?' asks the car dealer. 'Do you see that steep hill over there?' says the man, pointing. 'Well it will only get up to 75 up there'. 'That's not bad really sir, especially for a Lada. I can't see a problem with that'. 'Trouble is,' said the man, 'I live at 95'.
